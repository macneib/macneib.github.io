### Introduction
### What is ROS 2

ROS means Robot Operating System (but it's not an operating system)

#### Features

* A Framework, Prescribed patterns and Software libraries, and Tools to build robots applications.
* A standard way to build and manage robot fleets.
* Real-time system capable.
* New capabilities for embedded platforms.
* A real-world approach to gracefully degrading networks.
* Python and C++ perferred, however bindings for Java, Rust and Node.js available.

### What is Apache Pulsar

Apache Pulsar is a cloud-native, distributed messaging and streaming platform.

#### Features

* Very low publish and end-to-end latency.
* Seamless scalability to over a million topics.
* A simple client API with bindings for Java, Go, Python and C++.
* Guaranteed message delivery with persistent message storage provided by Apache BookKeeper.
* A serverless light-weight computing framework Pulsar Functions offers the capability for stream-native data processing.
* Tiered Storage offloads data from hot/warm storage to cold/longterm storage (such as S3 and GCS) when the data is aging out.
